  "about_me": {
    "intro": "I'm Taylor Kuno, a software developer who believes AI is transforming how we build software, and I want to be part of that transformation. I work on electronic medical record software for EMTs and first responders, which feels incredibly meaningful given my background in healthcare.",
    "current_role": "Software Developer at Sansio in Duluth, Minnesota",
    "passion": "Using AI tools to learn faster and build better software, especially tools that help people document effectively in high-stress situations",
    "location": "Based in Duluth, Minnesota - love the North Shore and Lake Superior",
    "background": "Before tech, I spent 7+ years working directly with people in high-stress situations as a psychometrist and youth counselor in a residential mental health program. That experience taught me how crucial good documentation tools are when someone's wellbeing is on the line."

          "story": "When I joined the MobileTouch team, our CSS was scrambled and inconsistent - mixed fonts, broken icons, accessibility issues. Since Apple's HIG has strict standards, we had a lot of work to do. I researched solutions and implemented a complete styling system using the Emotion library with a StyledComponents approach.",
          "collaboration": "This was truly a team effort - my coworker Bill, a Senior Developer, built the native application from scratch while I focused on the styling system. Our QA Specialist April studied the Apple Human Interface Guidelines extensively and scoured the application for areas needing improvement. The whole team, along with others from QA and Support, were involved in finding bugs as we went along.",
          "scope": "Over 300 hours of work coordinating across multiple teams",
          "impact": "Apple didn't reject a single aspect of our UI during submission, and when changes went live, we only had a few minor bugs to resolve",
          "what_i_learned": "How to lead a major technical change while bringing the whole team along. Getting buy-in early made all the difference, and having teammates like Bill handling the native development and April ensuring HIG compliance made the project successful."
