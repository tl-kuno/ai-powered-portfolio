  "about_me": {
    "intro": "I'm Taylor Kuno, a software developer who believes AI is transforming how we build software, and I want to be part of that transformation. I work on electronic medical record software for EMTs and first responders, which feels incredibly meaningful given my background in healthcare.",
    "current_role": "Software Developer at Sansio in Duluth, Minnesota (approaching 3 years)",
    "passion": "Using AI tools to learn faster and build better software, especially tools that help people in high-stress situations",
    "location": "Based in Duluth, Minnesota - love the North Shore and Lake Superior",
    "background": "Before tech, I spent 7+ years working directly with people in crisis situations as a psychometrist and youth counselor in a residential mental health program. That experience taught me how crucial good documentation tools are when someone's wellbeing is on the line."

      "team": "MobileTouch",
      "duration": "September 2022 - Present (started as intern, full-time since January 2023)",
      "what_i_do": "Build electronic medical record software specifically for EMTs, firefighters, and police officers who need to document in high-stress, pre-hospital situations",

        "Emotion library"
      ],
      "collaboration_story": "I work closely with product team members who are former EMTs - they help me understand the real-world constraints and keep me from over-engineering solutions. Our QA team member started in customer support, so she knows the product inside and out and serves as my reality check for how much change users can handle.",
      "major_projects": [
        {
          "name": "Apple Store UI Overhaul",
          "story": "When I joined the MobileTouch team, our CSS was scrambled and inconsistent - mixed fonts, broken icons, accessibility issues. Since Apple's HIG has strict standards, we had a lot of work to do. I researched solutions and implemented a complete styling system using the Emotion library with a StyledComponents approach.",
          "scope": "Over 300 hours of work coordinating across multiple teams",
          "impact": "Apple didn't reject a single aspect of our UI during submission, and when changes went live, we only had a few minor bugs to resolve",
          "what_i_learned": "How to lead a major technical change while bringing the whole team along. Getting buy-in early made all the difference."

          "approach": "We focus on building a culture of experimentation rather than instruction. I believe developers learn AI tools best when they feel empowered rather than mandated to use them.",
          "current_focus": "Using AI to improve our code documentation and testing suite, plus running hackathons on low-priority features to practice with new tools in low-pressure situations",
          "recognition": "My AI integration ideas have been selected for grant applications and received positive feedback from company leadership"
        }
      ],
      "growth_story": "Started as an intern with no formal JavaScript or React training - I taught myself these technologies because I could see they'd be important. Now I'm mentoring our new intern and leading major technical initiatives.",
      "daily_variety": "I love that our small team means I work on everything from simple label updates to full feature implementations. I've specialized in frontend and UX, but I'm becoming just as effective at building APIs and data management strategies."

        "duration": "September 2022 - January 2023",
        "story": "Worked on the web admin tool that manages configurations for the MobileTouch product. My main project was helping migrate legacy framework code to JavaScript and React - which was particularly satisfying since I'd taught myself these technologies.",
        "learning_moment": "This internship validated my decision to self-teach React and JavaScript outside of my Python-heavy computer science program."

      "documentation_challenges": "Had to maintain perfect standardization while keeping each child calm and motivated. Required keen observation skills to record test answers accurately while also writing high-quality behavioral observations.",
      "personal_systems": "I developed shorthand methods for tracking documentation on the fly and learned to systemize my process to record things accurately while staying attentive to the patient's experience",
      "first_programming_spark": "Spending hours scoring tests manually led me to create Excel programs to streamline the process and catch errors. This was one of my first experiences that made me curious about programming.",

      "key_insight": "I saw the full spectrum of responses to new technology - some providers were already power users, others were excited to learn, and some struggled to shift their workflows for various reasons",
      "connection_to_current_work": "This experience directly informs how we're approaching AI tool adoption at Sansio. The one-on-one mentoring sessions were crucial for helping skeptical or less technical users trust the process and try something new",

      "core_responsibilities": "Provided basic needs, maintained safety, guided youth using strength-based interventions, facilitated core skills groups, trained other staff in de-escalation techniques",
      "crisis_management": "Learning to stay calm when someone else is escalating, showing comfort around people in vulnerable states to build trust and create safety",
      "documentation_reality": "Had to do narrative documentation, often pen-and-paper during crisis situations, then write things up on computer later. It was challenging remembering details after time had passed - would have been useful to have better in-the-moment documentation tools",
      "teamwork_insights": "Managing conflicting priorities of patient safety and documentation relied on established procedures and high levels of teamwork. Having well-defined processes that everyone was trained on was crucial for stepping into high-stress situations with everyone on the same page",
      "connection_to_emt_work": "These experiences help me sympathize with EMT work and give me lived understanding of how having the right documentation system can make a big difference in patient outcomes"
